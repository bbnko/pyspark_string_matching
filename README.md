<h1> PySpark String Matching

  
<h4> In this exercise we have receipts from 2 different sources. The task is to find receipts that are the same and flag them to be removed in the future.

Flagging by receipt total and store is not enough, therefore item description needs to be used. 

Due to different OCR approaches, item descriptions of the same receipts may not be identical (example: 'banana' vs 'bananas'). This needs to be accounted for. <h4>
